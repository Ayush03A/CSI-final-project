## üìã Project Problem Statement

The goal of this project was to design and build a comprehensive data platform to address several key business and operational requirements for a growing e-commerce company. The specific tasks were:

1.  **Automated API Ingestion:** Create a pipeline to fetch data for 5 specific countries (India, US, UK, China, Russia) from the `restcountries.com` public API. Each country's data must be saved as a separate JSON file, named after the country.

2.  **Time-Specific Automation:** The API ingestion pipeline must be automated to run precisely two times a day: at 12:00 AM and 12:00 PM India Standard Time (IST).

3.  **Conditional Data Processing:** Create a pipeline to handle a daily customer data extract. The core logic should only be processed if the record count for the day is **greater than 500**.

4.  **Complex Nested Logic:** Within the customer pipeline, if the data is being processed (i.e., count > 500), an additional check must be performed. If the customer record count is **greater than 600**, a secondary child pipeline must be triggered to copy related product data.

5.  **Modular & Parameterized Design:** The solution must be designed in a modular way, where the parent customer pipeline can pass the exact record count as a parameter to the child product pipeline.

| Feature Implemented                | Business Value & Technical Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Medallion Architecture**         | ü•âü•àü•á Data is progressively refined through **Bronze** (raw), **Staging**, and **Silver** (cleansed) layers. This ensures data quality and provides a "single source of truth" in the `Silver.Customers` table, ready for analytics.                  |
| **CI/CD with Git Integration**     | üîÑ All development is version-controlled in Git. A professional `dev` -> `main` workflow with Pull Requests ensures code quality, enables collaboration, and prevents manual errors in production.                                                                       |
| **Secure by Design**               | üîë No passwords or sensitive keys are stored in code. **Azure Key Vault** manages all secrets, which are securely accessed at runtime by Azure Data Factory's **Managed Identity**, following zero-trust security principles.                                             |
| **High-Performance ELT**           | ‚ö° Instead of slow, traditional ETL, this solution uses a modern ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) pattern. The high-performance **`COPY INTO`** command in Azure Synapse Analytics is used for massively parallel data loading from the data lake.                                                  |
| **Automated Data Governance**      | üó∫Ô∏è By integrating with **Microsoft Purview**, the platform benefits from automated data discovery and, most importantly, end-to-end **data lineage tracking**, providing full traceability and building trust in the data.                                    |
| **Resilient & Dynamic Pipelines**  | ‚öôÔ∏è Pipelines are data-driven, not hardcoded. A "Set Variable" pattern was engineered to handle dynamic filenames reliably, and complex nested logic was solved by creating modular, reusable child pipelines. |

## üìÇ Project Implementation & Evidence

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic API Ingestion & Automation üåê

**Objective:** Build a fully automated pipeline to fetch country-specific metadata from a public REST API and schedule it to run twice daily in a specific timezone (IST).

#### Implementation Details:
- The pipeline uses a `Lookup` activity to read a list of countries from a central JSON configuration file, making it easily updatable.
- A `ForEach` loop processes all countries concurrently for maximum efficiency.
- A custom **Schedule Trigger** ensures data is refreshed reliably at 12:00 AM and 12:00 PM **India Standard Time**.

üì∏ **Evidence:**

- ‚úÖ **Pipeline Design:** The `PL_Ingest_Countries_To_Bronze` pipeline showing the `Lookup` -> `ForEach` pattern.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Conditional, High-Performance Database ELT üìà

**Objective:** Create a robust pipeline to ingest customer data, but only process it fully if the record count meets specific business rules, including triggering a child pipeline for related data.

#### Implementation Details:
- A modern **ELT (Extract-Load-Transform)** pattern was implemented using the high-performance **`COPY INTO`** command.
- An **`If Condition`** checks if the record count is > 500. More complex logic for the > 600 check is encapsulated in a **modular child pipeline** for clean, reusable code.
- The parent pipeline seamlessly passes the `RecordCount` as a parameter through the entire chain of child pipelines, demonstrating advanced orchestration.

üì∏ **Evidence:**

- ‚úÖ **Main Orchestration Pipeline:** The complete `PL_Ingest_Customers_To_Synapse_Incremental` pipeline showing the end-to-end flow.

## ‚ùó Challenges Faced & Solutions

This project was a journey of solving real-world engineering problems. The key challenges were:

- **Synapse T-SQL Dialect Quirks:** üöß Encountered multiple syntax limitations in Synapse Dedicated SQL Pools.
  - üëâ **Solution:** I systematically debugged each issue, refactoring the SQL scripts to use Synapse-compatible patterns like `IF EXISTS...DROP/CREATE` and explicitly creating log tables as `HEAP`.
- **ADF Dynamic Expression Bugs:** üêû The `Copy Data` activity's output did not reliably provide the filename for downstream use.
  - üëâ **Solution:** I engineered a robust "Set Variable" pattern to generate a unique filename at the start of the pipeline run and pass it as a variable, making the flow predictable and reliable.
- **Nested `If Condition` Limitation:** üë®‚Äçüíª Discovered that ADF does not support directly nesting `If Condition` activities.
  - üëâ **Solution:** I refactored the design to use a chain of modular child pipelines. This not only solved the problem but resulted in a cleaner, more scalable, and professional architecture.

## üß† Key Learnings

- **End-to-End Platform Design:** I mastered the integration of ADF, Synapse, ADLS, Key Vault, and Purview to build a complete and cohesive data platform.
- **Advanced Orchestration & Patterns:** I implemented complex conditional workflows, multi-level parameter passing, the Medallion Architecture, and high-performance ELT patterns.
- **Enterprise Best Practices:** I successfully applied critical concepts like CI/CD with Git, centralized secret management with Key Vault, and automated data governance with Purview.
- **Resilient Debugging:** This project taught me the immense value of reading error messages carefully, understanding system limitations, and being willing to pivot my design to find the most robust solution.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

This platform provides a strong foundation that can be extended with several key data-centric features:

1.  **Implement the Gold Layer:** üèÜ
    The next logical step is to build aggregated tables (data marts) on top of the `Silver.Customers` data. For example, creating a view or table that summarizes `Monthly Active Customers` by region.This pre-calculated data is highly optimized for business intelligence tools like Power BI, enabling faster dashboards and reports for business users.

2.  **Proactive Data Quality Monitoring:** üîî
    Enhance the existing Stored Procedure to move records that fail data quality checks (e.g., have a NULL email or an invalid country code) into a separate `Quarantine` table. An ADF activity could then check the count of this table.This creates a system for actively monitoring and managing data quality issues. If the quarantine table has data, an alert can be sent to the data team to investigate problems at the source.
